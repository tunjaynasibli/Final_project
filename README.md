# Final Project - EPL Last 5 seasons

I am going to use dataset from http://www.football-data.co.uk/. The data consisted of 5 files, each file provides statistics about each season, starting from 2016/20117 to 2020/2021. 

The main goal is to find the most successful team in terms of points, goals scored, clean sheet, goals scored/shoots on goal accuracy separately.

I will also try to look for correlations between features.

Having bookmakers odds, one of the other main goal is to find the most underrated team by bookmakers.

Last but not least, I will try to make a model of predictions.
